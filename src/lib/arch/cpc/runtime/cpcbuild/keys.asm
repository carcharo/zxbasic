; cpcbuild library -- keyboard matrix scan
;
; Written from scratch for this project (MIT); see core.asm. From the
; public documentation of the 8255 PPI, the AY-3-8912's I/O port and the
; keyboard matrix (cpcwiki.eu, CPC Firmware Guide); no library code.
;
; The CPC keyboard is a matrix of 10 rows x 8 columns, read through the
; AY-3-8912: PPI port C bits 0-3 pick the row, bits 6-7 are the AY's
; BDIR (bit 7) and BC1 (bit 6) lines (&C0 = select register, &40 =
; read it), and the AY's port A (register 14) returns the 8 column bits,
; 0 = pressed. Row 9 is joystick 0 (and DEL). A firmware key
; number is row * 8 + bit.
;
; CB_KEYS (sysvars.asm) holds the last scan, one byte per row, as read
; (bit = 0: pressed).

#include once <sysvars.asm>

; __CB_SCAN_KEYS -- reads the 10 rows into CB_KEYS, straight from the
; hardware, with interrupts as they are (off in compiled code, so the
; firmware's own keyboard scan cannot interleave with this one).
;
; Afterwards the PPI is as the firmware leaves it: control word &82
; (port A output, B input, C output), port C = the cassette bits it had
; before (bits 4-5: motor and write data) with the AY lines (bits 6-7)
; and row bits (0-3) inactive, AY register 14 selected (the register
; the firmware's own scan selects too). Writing the PPI control word
; clears its output latches, so the cassette bits are put back at once;
; the motor is off for a few microseconds only if it was on.
; Firmware entries called: none.
; Registers clobbered: AF, BC, DE, HL.
