; cpcbuild library core -- screen addressing for direct screen writes
;
; Written from scratch for this project (MIT, like Boriel's runtime),
; from public documentation of the CPC's screen layout; no code from
; CPCtelera or other libraries (cpcbuild/docs/notes.md, 2026-10-01).
;
; Library coordinates (notes.md, Q-4c.2): x in BYTES (0-79), y in pixel
; lines (0-199), from the top-left. A byte is 2 pixels in mode 0, 4 in
; mode 1, 8 in mode 2, in every mode 80 bytes per line.
;
; Screen layout: 16 KB at CB_BASE*256 (&C000, or &4000 for the
; double-buffer back screen), as eight 2 KB blocks, one per pixel line
; within a character row: line y is in block (y AND 7), at byte
; (y >> 3) * 80 + x of that block -- plus the hardware-scroll offset
; (below), wrapping within the 2 KB block.
;
; Hardware scroll (Q-4c.3): when the firmware scrolls text it moves the
; CRTC's start address rather than copying the screen, so after a
; scroll the top-left byte is at CB_OFFSET (0-&7FE) into each block.
; __CB_SYNC reads it from the firmware (SCR_GET_LOCATION); the library
; calls it in ScreenInit and after every WaitRetrace/FlipBuffer. All
; addresses below include it, and wrap at the end of the 2 KB block.
; Because of the offset, a row of bytes can cross the end of its block
; (it continues at the block's start): __CB_ROW_WRAPS tells a drawing
; routine when to use the careful per-byte path (__CB_INC_X).
;
; The CB_* variables are in the private runtime block (sysvars.asm).
